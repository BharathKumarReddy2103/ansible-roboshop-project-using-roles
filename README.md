## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ansible (2.9+ recommended)
- Python (3.x recommended)
- SSH access to target nodes
- Properly configured inventory file

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BharathKumarReddy2103/ansible-roboshop-roles.git
    cd ansible-roboshop-roles
    ```
2. **Configure your inventory:**
    - Edit `inventory.ini` with your server details.

3. **Edit group variables (if needed):**
    - Customize `group_vars/all.yml` for environment-specific variables.

---

## Usage

### Deploy Specific Microservice

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/roboshop-deploy.yml --tags catalogue -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

### Deploy All Microservices

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/roboshop-deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

---

## Key Ansible Concepts Used

- **Roles**: Modular structure for each microservice
- **Variables**: Centralized and environment-specific configuration
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates for config files
- **Handlers**: Service restarts and notifications
- **Loops & Tags**: Efficient and conditional task execution
- **Conditionals**: OS and environment checks
- **Error Handling**: Failures and retries
- **Crontab**: Automated scheduled jobs

---

## Best Practices & Security

- **Never commit real credentials or secrets.**  
  Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data and provide examples only.
- **Follow principle of least privilege for SSH and sudo access.**
- Modularize roles for scalability and maintainability.
- Use idempotent tasks to ensure safe re-runs.
